        Cloud computing is the delivery of different services through the Internet. 
        These resources include tools and applications like data storage, servers, databases, 
        networking, and software.

        Cloud computing is named as such because the information being accessed is found remotely 
        in the cloud or a virtual space. Companies that provide cloud services enable users to store 
        files and applications on remote servers and then access all the data via the Internet. 
        This means the user is not required to be in a specific place to gain access to it, 
        allowing the user to work remotely.

        Cloud computing takes all the heavy lifting involved in crunching and processing data 
        away from the device you carry around or sit and work at. It also moves all of that work 
        to huge computer clusters far away in cyberspace. The Internet becomes the cloud, and 
        voilà—your data, work, and applications are available from any device with which you can connect to the Internet, anywhere in the world.
